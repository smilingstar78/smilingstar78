# 👋 Hi, I’m Muskan Tariq 

### 👀 About Me
An enthusiastic AI Engineering student, deeply curious about how intelligence can be built with code.
I’m passionate about Machine Learning, Python, and creating things that actually work and look cute doing it. I'm always exploring new tech, learning by doing, and leveling up one project at a time 🚀.
I love breaking down complex topics into simple, fun builds — from student management systems to word games. If it’s code + creativity, I’m in 💡✨.

### 🌱 What I’m Working On
🧠 Diving deeper into Machine Learning (currently practicing linear regression & ridge regression)

📊 Playing with real-world datasets using pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib

📚 Following courses like CS50, freeCodeCamp, SoloLearn, and HP Life

🛠 Building personal projects to practice Flask, SQL, and front-end skills

🧩 Exploring how AI + imagination can make cool tools and fun games

### 💞️ Open to Collaborations On
- 👩‍💻  ML/AI projects

- 🌐 Anything with Flask, SQL, Python, or HTML/CSS/JS

- 🎓 Study collabs or learning together (bootcamp, course projects, etc.)

- 🎮 Mini fun projects like games, productivity tools, or web apps

- ✨ Open source, internships, hackathons — count me in!

If you’ve got ideas or want to build together, I’d love to hear from you 💌
